NoException is functional programming for Java exception handlers.
Many applications contain thousands of try-catch constructs and it's a mess.
Catch clauses are verbose, repetitive, inconsistent, buggy, and hard to test.
NoException provides a set of predefined exception handlers (try-catch replacements) that are concise and neat.
You can define your own reusable handlers to fit policies of your project.
